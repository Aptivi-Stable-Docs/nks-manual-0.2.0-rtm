# Network - NKS0051

This analyzer provides the following strings:

<table><thead><tr><th width="174">Context</th><th>String</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Error List</td><td>Caller uses <code>NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable</code> instead of <code>NetworkTools.NetworkAvailable</code></td></tr><tr><td>Suggestion Box</td><td>Use <code>NetworkTools.NetworkAvailable</code> instead of <code>NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable</code></td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>While <code>NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable</code> checks your network, it doesn't work on Android systems, so it's better to use <code>NetworkTools.NetworkAvailable</code>. Please note that this will return <code>false</code> if there is no connectivity for Android systems.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Extended Description

This code analyzer detects the usage of `GetIsNetworkAvailable` from the `NetworkInterface` class found in the `System.Net.NetworkInformation` namespace.

Normally, `NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable` would return true if there are network interfaces that are ready to connect (their state is UP). However, this approach doesn't work on Android systems as Nitrocid doesn't build for Xamarin.Android, which has the necessary libraries for Java bindings to the Android API.

As a result, you'll have to use the sensible `NetworkTools.NetworkAvailable` property to allow you to check to see if there are ready network interfaces. Please note that if you have no working internet connection, even if your WiFi is turned on in your Android device, it'll report as false.

### Analysis Comparison

To get a brief insight about how this analyzer works, compare the two code blocks shown to you below:

#### Before the fix

<pre class="language-csharp" data-title="Somewhere in your mod code..." data-line-numbers><code class="lang-csharp">public static void MyFunction()
{
<strong>    bool available = NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable;
</strong>}
</code></pre>

#### After the fix

<pre class="language-csharp" data-title="Somewhere in your mod code..." data-line-numbers><code class="lang-csharp">public static void MyFunction()
{
<strong>    bool available = NetworkTools.NetworkAvailable;
</strong>}
</code></pre>

### Suppression

You can suppress this suggestion by including it in the appropriate place, whichever is convenient.

### Recommendation

We recommend that every caller which use this function use the recommended abovementioned method.
