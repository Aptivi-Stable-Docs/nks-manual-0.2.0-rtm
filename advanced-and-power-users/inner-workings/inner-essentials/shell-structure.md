# Shell Structure

Kernel shells can be built by implementing two different interfaces and base classes. Why two? Because the shell handler relies on:

* `BaseShell` and `IShell`: To hold shell type and initialization code
* `BaseShellInfo<ShellType>` and `IShellInfo`: To hold shell commands and the base shell

To learn more about general information about shells, consult the page below:

## Return codes

The kernel exceptions can be used as return codes, though you'll have to reference to a class, called `KernelExceptionTools`, to be able to get an error code by exception type using the `GetErrorCode()` function. In addition to that, you can also use it with an instance of a kernel exception instance, in case you've wrapped the code with the try...catch clause and that you're catching all the `KernelException` errors, which almost all APIs throw on either a failure condition or an invalid operation.

{% hint style="info" %}
All kernel exception codes consist of `10000` added with the enumeration number of the kernel exception type.
{% endhint %}

Here's a minimal example of what exit does when you're trying to exit the mother shell:

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="lang-csharp">public override int Execute(CommandParameters parameters, ref string variableValue)
{
    if (ShellManager.IsOnMotherShell())
    {
        TextWriters.Write(Translate.DoTranslation("You can't exit the mother shell. Did you mean to log out of your account, shut the kernel down, or reboot it?"), KernelColorType.Error);
<strong>        return KernelExceptionTools.GetErrorCode(KernelExceptionType.ShellOperation);
</strong>    }
    ShellManager.KillShell();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

## Error codes

The error code variable, `MESHErrorCode`, holds information about the last process error code, whether it's a success (a zero value) or a failure (non-zero value). In addition to what Terminaux already provides, these values are supported:

### Error codes that come from the commands

* `10000 + KernelExceptionType`
  * Some commands throw this value from any `KernelException` that is thrown by the command executor. Indicates that the command failed to perform its operation, but the kernel already knows about it.
    * Example: If `KernelExceptionType.Config` is thrown from the command executor, and the command knows how to return this exception as an error code, such as using `KernelExceptionTools.GetErrorCode()`, then it'll return the sum of `10000 + 7`, which is `10007`.

### Command-specific error codes
