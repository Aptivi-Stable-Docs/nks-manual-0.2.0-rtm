# ScoreSim

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (334).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

ScoreSim is actually a helper application for showing just the scores for the two teams in a sports game. Whether it's a standard game (freeform), soccer, or basketball, this allows you to track the scores.

To start ScoreSim in different modes, you can either start it up without any switches, or you can start it up with the appropriate switches for basketball and for soccer.

### Controls

* `TAB` to switch teams
* `I` to add one point (two points for basketball)
* `SHIFT + I` to add two points (one point for soccer, and three points for basketball)
* `Y` to add one yellow card
* `R` to add one red card
* `ESC` to exit
