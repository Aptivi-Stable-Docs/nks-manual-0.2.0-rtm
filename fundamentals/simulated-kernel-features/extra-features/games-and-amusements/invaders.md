Invaders is an attempt to simulate the original Space Invaders game with just the aliens. You'll have to try shooting all the aliens that show. If you fail to shoot all of them before they go to the bottom, the game is over.

### Controls

* `Left Arrow` to move the spaceship left
* `Right Arrow` to move the spaceship right
* `Space` to shoot
* `ESC` to exit
