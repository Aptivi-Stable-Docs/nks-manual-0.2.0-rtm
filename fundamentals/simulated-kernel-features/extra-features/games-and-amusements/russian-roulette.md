# Russian Roulette

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 0.1.0, this feature has been moved to the kernel addons.
{% endhint %}

Russian Roulette tests your luck by letting you select your bet whether it's `True` (T) or `False` (F). If you're lucky, you're a winner! Else, you're a loser.

## Controls

You just press either `T` or `F` to test your luck.
