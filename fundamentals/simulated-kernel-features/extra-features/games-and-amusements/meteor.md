<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You are a spaceship, which is represented by the green triangle in the left edge of the screen, and the red meteors are trying to destroy you. As soon as the meteor destroys you, it's game over. Use the controls below to learn how to play the game.

In addition to the normal mode, you can also make use of the dodge mode using the `meteordodge` command. You'll not be able to shoot in this mode.
