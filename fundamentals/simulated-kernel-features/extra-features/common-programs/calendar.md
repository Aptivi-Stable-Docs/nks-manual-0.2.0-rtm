# Calendar

The calendar shows you days, weeks, and months within the selected year. It not only shows how many days in a month, but it also shows the weekends in a special color or formatting and the business days in the normal color. A calendar can handle events in either a single day or within a day range. Modern calendars get synced with the latest holidays in your country.

The simulated kernel provides you with the calendar management application that attempts to simulate the above functionality.
