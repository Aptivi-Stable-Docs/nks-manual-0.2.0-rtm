# Stocks

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Stocks is a 0.1.1 extra feature that allows you to see the most accurate simple stock price analysis of a company that is registered in the NASDAQ database. The interactive TUI that shows you the hourly stock information can be run by executing the "`stock`" command that allows you to check the current stock prices. You can optionally run this command with the company symbol.

You might be prompted for your [AlphaVantage API key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Get one for free here, but beware that it only allows 25 requests maximum per day.
