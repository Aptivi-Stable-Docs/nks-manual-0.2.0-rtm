# Contacts

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The contacts application lets you list your contacts that are imported from the contacts folder found under the `KSContactsImport` folder. It shows you basic information about your contacts.

The contacts application is usually found in your computer under the form of a feature in your favorite mail client or under the form of a standalone application. It's also found in your smartphone in which you can make phone calls and send SMS messages.

***

## <mark style="color:$primary;">Usage</mark>

Nitrocid contains this standalone application and can be executed by invoking the `contacts` command.

You can also perform contact management without the contacts interactive TUI by using one of the following four commands:

| Command          | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contactinfo`    | Shows you contact information                                    |
| `importcontacts` | Imports the contacts from either a MeCard string or a vCard file |
| `listcontacts`   | Lists all the contacts                                           |
| `loadcontacts`   | Loads all the contacts                                           |

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that Nitrocid KS is unable to make phone calls and send SMS messages to your contacts as it requires a special device, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) phones, to be able to make calls from your computer, and we don't intend to simulate that.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:$primary;">Importing contacts</mark>

The contact application can import your contacts from the `KSContactsImport` folder if your contacts file is one of the supported formats by the powerful VisualCard library:

* VCF contact files holding a single contact (version 2.1, 3.0, 4.0)
* VCF contact files holding multiple contacts (same version, mixed versions)
* Android contacts database file (`contacts2.db`)

To import MeCard contacts, expand the below section.

The contact application can also import your contact through a short MeCard syntax given to you by a QR code behind it. Below is an example of a complete MeCard syntax:

```
MECARD:N:Sanders,John,,,;TEL:495-522-3560;EMAIL:john.s@acme.co;ADR:,,Los Angeles,,,,USA;NOTE:Note test for VisualCard;;
```
