# Windows

Upgrading your kernel on Windows is pretty simple, depending on the way you've installed the simulator. To upgrade your kernel, choose a method.

## Method 1: Windows Installer

You can update Nitrocid KS using the Windows Installer method.

1. Download the latest Windows Installer EXE file from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases)
2. Double-click on the EXE file and follow the instructions
3. Go to your installation path and double-click on `Nitrocid.exe`.

## Method 2: Using Chocolatey

Any updates to the KS Chocolatey package can be done using a built-in Chocolatey command. To update the kernel, follow these steps:

1. Open your favorite terminal emulator, like ConEmu
2. Run `choco upgrade ks`
3. Once the upgrade is done, run KS like you normally would

## Method 3: Manually unpacking

Nitrocid KS can also be manually updated in case the automatic updater failed to update. To update the kernel, perform the same steps as in installing KS. Run the executable to upgrade your kernel configuration files to the latest.

1. Ensure that you have all the required software installed
2. Download the latest release ZIP file from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases)
3. Unpack the ZIP archive to any folder of your choice
4. Open your favorite terminal emulator, like ConEmu, and change the working directory to a folder containing the Nitrocid KS executable
5. Execute `ks` or `Nitrocid.exe` to start the kernel
