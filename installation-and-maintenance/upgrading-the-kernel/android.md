# Android

The only way to upgrade your kernel in Android is to unpack the updated kernel files manually. This method also works for bleeding-edge builds. To upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Ubuntu proot
   * `proot-distro login ubuntu`
2. Install wget to download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases)
   * `apt install wget`
   * `wget https://github.com/Aptivi/Nitrocid/releases/download/v0.x.x.x/0.x.x.x-bin.zip`
3. Use unzip to extract the files
   * `unzip 0.x.x.x-bin.zip`
4. Execute `dotnet Nitrocid.dll`
